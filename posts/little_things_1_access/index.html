<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about <code>public</code> vs. <code>private</code>! Folks who know C++ may be familiar with
these concepts, but here is a quick example:</p>
<pre><code>class MyType {
public:
  void MyPublicFunction();

private:
  void InternalDetail();
};
</code></pre>

<p>One of the things that has always been frustrating to me are exactly how
<code>public</code> and <code>private</code> work here. They introduce <em>regions</em> of declarations, not
a single declaration. And the default depends on how you declare the class? üò§
This is almost certainly just a personal thing, and I have no evidence this is a
real source of confusion, but it grinds my gears. Anyways, the result is:</p>
<pre><code>class MyType {
  void PrivateByDefault();

public:
  void MarkedAsPublic();
};

struct MyOtherType {
  void PublicByDefault();

private:
  void MarkedAsPrivate();
};
</code></pre>

<p>A pretty common model that is much more satisfying is to put these on the
specific things that are public or private. Most languages also require that
<em>public</em> APIs are explicitly marked, and have a default slightly broader than
C++&rsquo;s &ldquo;private&rdquo;. Java&rsquo;s default is &ldquo;package&rdquo;, and C# and Swift call it
&ldquo;internal&rdquo;. Rust just defines its &ldquo;private&rdquo; in a similar way. The results look
like:</p>
<p><pre><code>package LittleThings;

public class AccessExample {
  void defaultPackage() {
    // ...
  }

  private void explicitlyPrivate() {
    // ...
  }

  public void explicitlyPublic() {
    // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>namespace LittleThings;

public class AccessExample {
  void defaultInternal() {
    // ...
  }

  private void explicitlyPrivate() {
    // ...
  }

  public void explicitlyPublic() {
    // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>public class MyType {
  func defaultInternalMethod() {
    // ...
  }

  private func explicitlyPrivateMethod() {
    // ...
  }

  public func explicitlyPublicMethod() {
    // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>pub struct MyType {
  // ...
}

impl MyType {
  fn default_private_method(&amp;amp;self) {
    // ...
  }

  pub fn explicitly_public_method(&amp;amp;self) {
      // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>These all make lots of sense, and seem much more satisfying.</p>
<p>Then there is Go which uses the <em>case</em> of the name to determine the access
level. I struggle with this one as I think the semantic difference here is far
too important to convey with such a subtle distinction. But it does at least
enforce naming convention consistency&hellip; Still, personally, this is not my
favorite design:</p>
<pre><code>package little_things

type MyType struct {
	// ...
}

func (obj MyType) lowerCamelIsPrivate() {
	// ...
}

func (obj MyType) UpperCamelIsPublic() {
	// ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>But then I saw something interesting with Kotlin:</p>
<pre><code>package little_things

class MyType {
  fun public_by_defalut() {
    // ...
  }

  private fun explicitly_private() {
    // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The access specifiers are still on each declaration, but now the default is
<em>public</em> rather than private! This was a big surprise to me when I first saw it.
