      <description>Earlier this year, while at CppNow, I completely broke the RSS feed for this blog. Really sorry about that, and thanks to Jonathan for pointing it out. However, I have been distracted with work, life, and a bunch of complications over the intervening months and have only now managed to fix it. I hope? Let&amp;rsquo;s hope.
As is all-too-common, the fix was easy once I understood how to fix it and understood the surprising constraints on how to add that fix to the blog infrastructure.</description>
